- Upload Test-Receipts (tests/test_receipts) and Test with AI Scanners (stub testing_Scanner / OpenAI / Gemini) if it adds expenses correctly (adjust ai scanning methods if necessary)
- Add automatic tests for the ai expense receipt scanning (to test functionality on changes and for different future AI scanner providers)

- [x] make it possible to upload batch receipt images (like 5 images at the same time), and to control all of them by scrolling down one by one and/or press save to batch save all of them

- [x] make all properties configured in core/config.py configurable via UI by the user


## add_expense

- [x] in the ui, the big plus "+" button that enables me the upload images should be centered and bigger / better visible for the user

- [x] it should be possible to click the image preview in add_expense to enlarge it and view the full original picture
    ```python
    # Image Preview
    preview_image = ui.image().classes('max-h-64 w-full object-contain mb-4 rounded-lg hidden')
    ```
