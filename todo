- Upload 10-15 Test-Receipts and Test with OpenAI / Gemini if it adds expenses correctly (adjust ai scanning methods if necessary)
- Add automatic tests for the ai expense receipt scanning (to test functionality on changes and for different future AI scanner providers)

- make all properties configured in core/config.py configurable via UI by the user


## add_expense

- in the ui, the big plus "+" button that enables me the upload images should be centered and bigger / better visible for the user

- it should be possible to click the image preview in add_expense to enlarge it and view the full original picture
```python
# Image Preview
preview_image = ui.image().classes('max-h-64 w-full object-contain mb-4 rounded-lg hidden')
```
