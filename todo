- [x] at add_expense Amount input, always round decimal numbers, e.g. "17.5" should always be saved as "17.50", input "5" as "5.00".

- [x] in settings page, openai and gemini api key should be hidden from UI if AI provider: "testing" is selected. the according API key settings should only show if the appropriate provider is selected, e.g. "openai" provider then the OpenAI API key setting should show, vise-versa if "gemini" selected then show google gemini api key setting

- [ ] fix UI darkmode, it currently looks very bad for readability for the user

- [ ] on the dashboard screen, change place of "Legend" in Piechart or the 2 buttons "download plot as png" and "procude by plot.ly", because currently they are on top of each other. Maybe move the 2 buttons from plot.ly to the bottom of the piechart (info: this only happens when mouse hovers over piechart)

- [ ] adjust header of all pages to be responsible for different viewports (e.g. phone). Also do this for the History Page's table (on phone should still be usable)
