- [x] in history page, changing the category for an existing expense should only show the expense categories not the income categories. vise-versa changing category of an existing income should only show income categories, as long as the type is income.

- [x] at add_expense Amount input, always round decimal numbers, e.g. "17.5" should always be saved as "17.50", input "5" as "5.00".

- [x] in settings page, openai and gemini api key should be hidden from UI if AI provider: "testing" is selected. the according API key settings should only show if the appropriate provider is selected, e.g. "openai" provider then the OpenAI API key setting should show, vise-versa if "gemini" selected then show google gemini api key setting

- [x] make history page, upload Receipt form (after uploading an AI Upload receipt) and Recent Transactions (on dashboard) more mobile friendly on smaller viewports (show only most important parts on mobile)

- [x] adjust history page to switch between table view (desktop >= 785px) and card view (mobile < 785px) correctly

- [ ] in add expense: when opening the category drop down (or any dropdown), the drop down shouldnt go up blocking a lot, it should go conventionally down

- [ ] fix UI darkmode, it currently looks very bad for readability for the user

- [ ] on the dashboard screen, change place of "Legend" in Piechart or the 2 buttons "download plot as png" and "procude by plot.ly", because currently they are on top of each other. Maybe move the 2 buttons from plot.ly to the bottom of the piechart (info: this only happens when mouse hovers over piechart)

- [x] adjust header of all pages to be responsible for different viewports (e.g. phone). Also do this for the History Page's table (on phone should still be usable)

- [ ] in transaction history, give each transaction an ongoing id, so that i can find out the total done transactions and see if theres any missed/lost transaction over the history

- [ ] add re-occuring expenses feature, that can be configured and are "booked" every month automatically, e.g. subscriptions or rent

- [ ] improve / modernize the frontend according to docs/new-ui.jpg (maybe combined with raspberry pi deployment for better performance)


# RaspberryPi Build
- [ ] create automatic occasional backup (db dump to file) with automatic upload/persist to somewhere in the cloud, so that i can access backups on other devices in the cloud outside of the raspbeerypi environment

- [ ] improve performance for deployment on Rapsberry Pi Zero 2 W. analyze if there are any improvememts to be made, or if a raspberry pi upgrade is needed

# Research
- [ ] TaskSync Tool for GitHub Copilot to save premium requests, url: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=4regab.tasksync-chat
- [ ] add local LLM adapter (maybe ollama or vllm?) with OCR capabitilty, that works the same way as a paid one does (testing!). That way, users dont need a paid AI API adapter (e.g. openai) and can still reliably use the app

- [ ] currently using venv, maybe use uv instead? https://github.com/astral-sh/uv. first make a plan before implementation.
